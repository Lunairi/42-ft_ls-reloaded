# 42-ft_ls-reloaded
Rewriting my ft_ls again to better be fit for the later 42 projects such as minishell. This will fix some of the issues I did not know about in my first ft_ls. Data structure will be improved, functionality and smoothness of the overall program will be improved so that the functions of ls performs better. First attempt in ft_ls was a learning experience, this time it's for optimization. (First ft_ls https://github.com/Lunairi/42-ft_ls)
